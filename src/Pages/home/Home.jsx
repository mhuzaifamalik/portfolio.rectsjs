            My journey began 3 years ago When I start my studies in software engineering, thatâ€™s the beginning of my adventure. Since last year I've been working as a full-time independent web developer with various businesses all around the world. In this period, I've worked with excellent individuals and benefited from their expertise, in addition to continuously developing my technical skills after each project.
